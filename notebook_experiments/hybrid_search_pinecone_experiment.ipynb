I like I was saying, like, maybe twelve years ago. I'm not sure.<br>StartMs:717.95|EndMs:725.975|customer:And then I started they started re re referring me to the different doctors, and I went to the cancer care center. And then they<br>StartMs:727.19|EndMs:731.05|customer:the doctor confirmed it after different doctors had the<br>StartMs:731.91|EndMs:744.8|customer:appointments with different doctors.

I used to use so so the the that's the only thing we used to have at one time, you know, way back then. I used to use that all the time because I was raising my my last child, I think, or two. And I I had it all the time, so I would use it. Use little, like, like, as a deodorant and private parts.<br>StartMs:775.16|EndMs:778.38|Agent:And have you ever used Justin Justin shower to shower?<br>StartMs:779.28|EndMs:780.82|customer:Yeah. I used to use the products.<br>StartMs:782.115|EndMs:785.415|Agent:Okay.

I guess it probably went to that area, but I don't remember just directly putting it there. But I guess, you know, I<br>StartMs:801.945|EndMs:805.245|Agent:Okay. Would you say that was the shower to shower or the baby powder?<br>StartMs:802.84|EndMs:803.855|customer:I'm just telling<br>StartMs:806.415|EndMs:806.915|customer:Pardon?<br>StartMs:807.4|EndMs:810.94|Agent:Would you say that was the shower to shower or the baby powder?<br>StartMs:811.35|EndMs:815.21|customer:Well, both. I used to use them like a deodorant, you know, like, to put down there.<br>StartMs:815.64|EndMs:816.14|Agent:Mhmm.<br>StartMs:817.35|EndMs:821.185|customer:And and the shower to shower to shower, and that's it.<br>StartMs:827.26|EndMs:831.84|Agent:And when did you first using the baby powder? First start using the baby<br>StartMs:831.32|EndMs:835.815|customer:I don't I really don't remember because I used to use it all the time with my kids. You know?<br>StartMs:837.495|EndMs:838.875|customer:So I don't really remember.<br>StartMs:840.455|EndMs:846.01|customer:But I used to buy it just because we didn't have anything else by that at that time, you know, way back<br>StartMs:848.15|EndMs:853.015|Agent:So I will need to know your best estimate for the year that you start using<br>StartMs:850.47|EndMs:850.97|customer:then.<br>StartMs:853.885|EndMs:856.305|customer:Oh my goodness. Maybe<br>StartMs:856.275|EndMs:856.775|Agent:it.<br>StartMs:860.045|EndMs:862.625|customer:maybe seventy two.<br>StartMs:863.13|EndMs:864.67|Agent:Nineteen seventy two.<br>StartMs:867.75|EndMs:869.45|customer:Seventy two, seventy.<br>StartMs:871.165|EndMs:876.385|customer:Maybe even before that.

Go ahead, ma'am.<br>StartMs:899.87|EndMs:906.975|Agent:When would you say well, would you say that you start the baby powder in nineteen seventy two also or just the shower to shower?<br>StartMs:906.895|EndMs:919.2|customer:Probably so. No. I used to we used the the products. That's what I'm I'm trying to say. I used to use them because that's what we had. And I think I can go back because I'm trying trying to think for my the the the<br>StartMs:920.535|EndMs:927.195|customer:as far back as I can remember is when my son was born, probably. That's a that that's as far back as I can go.<br>StartMs:927.54|EndMs:930.28|Agent:Okay. And when was the last time you used it?<br>StartMs:930.93|EndMs:936.39|customer:Oh, I don't know. All that time, I guess up until maybe before<br>StartMs:937.805|EndMs:947.265|customer:I my son was I don't know. When he was already maybe two years old. I don't remember, ma'am. Those are things that I don't we I didn't pay attention to.<br>StartMs:948.66|EndMs:951.56|Agent:Okay. So I will need to know the best estimate.<br>StartMs:952.42|EndMs:958.495|Agent:What so was your son born in nineteen seventy two, or he was born after that<br>StartMs:957.625|EndMs:960.845|customer:He was in nineteen seventy. And then<br>StartMs:960.155|EndMs:960.895|Agent:in nineteen<br>StartMs:961.785|EndMs:972.68|customer:and then my my other son was born in nineteen seventy two. But I and and I use them all the time, so I I don't know to tell you really because, you know, you don't pay attention to those things.<br>StartMs:973.065|EndMs:973.565|Agent:Okay.<br>StartMs:976.985|EndMs:982.73|Agent:So you mentioned that when your son was two years old, you stopped using it. Is that correct?<br>StartMs:985.67|EndMs:1001.23|customer:I think so. I'm I'm not sure what happened or if if I still continued using it, but I don't think I because I think it was past the age of using it. And I've been since I had to buy it for him, I used to use it too, you know, all the time.<br>StartMs:1002.4|EndMs:1002.9|Agent:Mhmm.<br>StartMs:1003.84|EndMs:1006.74|Agent:So when would you say you stop using it on yourself?<br>StartMs:1007.765|EndMs:1011.705|customer:Oh my goodness. Again. I don't know.<br>StartMs:1013.405|EndMs:1013.905|Agent:Okay.<br>StartMs:1013.845|EndMs:1017.54|customer:Probably, like I said, when he was maybe two years old. I'm I'm not certain.<br>StartMs:1018.365|EndMs:1021.94|Agent:Okay. So in nineteen seventy four, that's when he was<br>StartMs:1025.28|EndMs:1025.78|Agent:two.<br>StartMs:1034.935|EndMs:1043.18|Agent:And is it the same for the shower to shower? Did you stop using it when he was also two years old at the shower to shower? Or<br>StartMs:1042.405|EndMs:1048.665|customer:No. I kept using the shower to shower. No. And then and then and then what was it?<br>StartMs:1050.56|EndMs:1059.845|customer:Something else came along, and I stopped using it. I liked it better. But it wasn't until way after that that something else came, you know, because that's all we didn't have choice of much.<br>StartMs:1061.765|EndMs:1071.25|customer:So something else came up. I don't even remember what it was. I think it was I don't know. Some purple. I I remember the color of the of the thing, but I don't remember what it was like.<br>StartMs:1074.91|EndMs:1075.89|customer:I don't remember.<br>StartMs:1077.135|EndMs:1107.36|customer:And I liked it better, so I stopped using it. I don't I don't really remember, ma'am. I don't remember those those dates. I don't remember because you don't pay attention when you stop, when you start, you know, just at random. Yeah. I'm I'm just talking to you because I don't really remember. But I do remember that something else came, and my son didn't need it. So I started using some something else. It was something purple. I don't even remember the name of it, but it was a purple little a container of shower to shower.<br>StartMs:1077.27|EndMs:1077.77|Agent:Okay.<br>StartMs:1109|EndMs:1112.14|Agent:Okay. And when would you say you stopped using the shower to shower?<br>StartMs:1112.765|EndMs:1121.81|customer:I tell you about when my son was about two years old, and after that sometime after that, I don't remember, Maybe two thousand<br>StartMs:1122.67|EndMs:1127.965|customer:three or four, something other than that came on the market, and I started using it.<br>StartMs:1128.765|EndMs:1132.305|Agent:Okay. So two thousand three or two thousand four.<br>StartMs:1138.98|EndMs:1142.865|Agent:And what city do you live in now? Well, what state? I'm sorry.<br>StartMs:1141.8|EndMs:1142.94|customer:I live in Pomona,<br>StartMs:1143.825|EndMs:1144.805|Agent:In what state?<br>StartMs:1144.2|EndMs:1144.7|customer:California,<br>StartMs:1145.745|EndMs:1146.245|Agent:California.<br>StartMs:1145.995|EndMs:1146.495|customer:California.<br>StartMs:1159.78|EndMs:1160.28|Agent:Okay.<br>StartMs:1165.345|EndMs:1180.295|Agent:So, unfortunately, we cannot accept your potential case at this time. As such, we're not able to represent you and will not be filing a lawsuit on your behalf. But this does not mean you don't have a case, so I recommend you to reach out to another law firm for a second opinion. Do you have any questions for me?<br>StartMs:1182.075|EndMs:1207.83|customer:No. Except that I went through all that, and then you tell me that I don't even qualify. So that's why that's the reason that I gave up with the others because I heard from different people that you go through a whole lot of questions and this and that and the other, and then they tell you we don't qualify. So then you give all your information. You get the law firm has all your information, and then you don't even qualify. And that's the reason that I was so turned off. You know?<br>StartMs:1208.62|EndMs:1210|Agent:I'm sorry to hear this.<br>StartMs:1208.77|EndMs:1210.23|customer:And I don't think that's right.<br>StartMs:1211.685|EndMs:1226.74|Agent:I'm sorry to hear that. But it's the questionnaire I put you on based on what you gave me into the questionnaire, and you do not qualify. But this does not mean you don't have a case. As I stated, you're just not with the Saddle Rock Legal Group.<br>StartMs:1227.53|EndMs:1233.585|customer:What what was the what what didn't I qualify for about? I had the I had the surgery.<br>StartMs:1231.905|EndMs:1232.645|Agent:So there's<br>StartMs:1234.625|EndMs:1240.03|Agent:so there's the current lack of evidence to see our case criteria based on what you told me.<br>StartMs:1234.765|EndMs:1235.905|customer:I had the cancer.<br>StartMs:1241.06|EndMs:1250.415|customer:Well, you know, you shouldn't have that out there because so many people don't remember. I mean, you don't remember when you stopped, when you started out because there's there I mean, it doesn't<br>StartMs:1251.435|EndMs:1261.08|customer:it doesn't come to mind. Okay. I started using this product. I start I stopped using this product and this and that. You don't make notes of those things, you know, when it's been so long.<br>StartMs:1262.275|EndMs:1266.055|customer:And I don't think it's fair. They put they they<br>StartMs:1267.155|EndMs:1287.74|customer:they they put this advertisement out, and then you give all your information, and then the law firm has all your information. And how do I know that you're really a real, real legal place? How do I know? How do I know I'm talking to somebody that's really a righteous firm? I know that I I remember the name of it, but I don't know that you are.<br>StartMs:1280.805|EndMs:1281.305|Agent:Okay.<br>StartMs:1288.62|EndMs:1291.68|Agent:Okay. Yes. We are. So thank you so much for speaking.<br>StartMs:1290.14|EndMs:1292.56|customer:You might be somebody that just wants all my information.<br>StartMs:1293.705|EndMs:1298.285|Agent:Alright. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me at Federal Legal Group. Have a great day.\")]"
